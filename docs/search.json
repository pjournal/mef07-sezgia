She designed her page with a navigation toolbar and positioned each sections. She used jolla template in about.qmd to create about page, inserting images and links with icons.. She created projects.qmd and listings with contents of posts which is a directory defined for this blog. She further personalized the page with customized themes and used code tools."

The size of the bubbles represents a third variable, which can be used to show the importance of that variable or to identify relationships between the three variables.\n\n# Load ggplot2 library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Sample data\ncars &lt;- mtcars\ncars$name &lt;- rownames(cars)\n\n# Generate random data\nset.seed(123)\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = rnorm(10),\n  y = rnorm(10),\n  size = runif(10, min = 5, max = 20)\n)\n\n# Create a bubble chart\nggplot(data, aes(x, y, size = size)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 10)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Basic Bubble Chart\", \n    x = \"X-Axis\", \n    y = \"Y-Axis\",\n    size = \"Y\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Creating a List\nA list in R is used to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way.\n\n# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 4\nmy_vector &lt;- 1:4 \n\n# Matrix with numerics from 1 up to 9\nmy_matrix &lt;- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)\n\nlibrary(qcc)\n#Create a data frame with the product and its count\n\noffice_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  product = c(\"Office desks\", \"Chairs\", \"Filing cabinets\", \"Bookcases\"),\n  count = c(100, 80, 70, 60)\n)\n\n# Elements of the built-in data frame \nmy_df &lt;- office_df[1:4,]\n\n# Construct list with these different elements:\nmy_list &lt;- list(my_vector,my_matrix,my_df)\nmy_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n[[2]]\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3    6    9\n\n[[3]]\n          product count\n1    Office desks   100\n2          Chairs    80\n3 Filing cabinets    70\n4       Bookcases    60"
